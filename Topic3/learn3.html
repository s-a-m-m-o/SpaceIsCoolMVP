					<h3>Space Probes</h3>					
					<br>
					<P>A probe is a spacecraft that travels through space to collect science information.
					<br>Probes do not have astronauts. Probes send data back to Earth for scientists to study.</P>
					<br>
					<p>Sputnik 1 was the first probe to go into space. It was launched on Oct. 4, 1957,
					<br>by the former Soviet Union.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Mariner 2 was the first probe to study another planet. 
					<br>On Dec. 14, 1962, Mariner 2 flew past the planet Venus, confirming that Venus is the hottest planet.</p>
					<br>
					<p>One of the most famous probes is Voyager 1. It has traveled further in space than any human-made object. 
					<br>It launched into space in 1977. Voyager 1 flew past Jupiter and Saturn
					<br>and then headed for the edge of our solar system. 
					<br>As of Feb. 1, 2010, the spacecraft was 16.8 billion kilometers (about 10.4 billion miles) from Earth.</p>
